# Fractal geometry in remote sensing images

In this repository, you can find an implementation and recopilation of several methods used to estimate the "fractal dimension" of a remoted sensed image in order to calsiffy and analyze it. 
There is also a document written in spanish which explains the concept of fractal dimension mathematically and how the methods are implemented
